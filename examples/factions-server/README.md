# Factions Server

## TLDR

Standalone consumer example for a Paper factions server on ix.

It builds one VM image with Paper `26.1.2`, a curated plugin set, a `12000`
block world border, a 4064-block max-height datapack, BlueMap on TCP `8100`,
Simple Voice Chat on UDP `24454`, and local-only RCON for managed reloads.

Customize real player UUIDs and spawn/claim policy before using it with real
players.

## Shape

- [`minecraft.nix`](minecraft.nix) wires the Minecraft service.
- [`plugins.nix`](plugins.nix) selects factions, economy, audit, map, voice, and
  scripting plugins from the generated catalog.
- [`world.nix`](world.nix) owns the seed and border constants.
- [`world-height.nix`](world-height.nix) contains the generated datapack.
- [`bukkit.nix`](bukkit.nix), [`paper.nix`](paper.nix), and
  [`spigot.nix`](spigot.nix) hold loader config files.

The plugin URLs and hashes come from
[`images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json`](../../images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json).
Regenerate the catalog from the repo root with:

```bash
nix run .#update-mods -- --manifest images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json
```

The world border is applied after startup through local RCON. RCON stays off the
firewall by default; ix uses it to apply the border and reload managed Paper
plugins during a switch.
