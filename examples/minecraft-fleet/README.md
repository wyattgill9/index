# Minecraft Fleet

This directory is a multi-file example of a production-shaped Minecraft network on ix.

```text
examples/minecraft-fleet/
  flake.nix        # exposes runnable fleet commands
  default.nix      # defines the fleet graph
  proxy.nix        # Velocity + Geyser + Floodgate edge node
  folia-node.nix   # shared Folia backend node module
```

## Topology

- Velocity is the edge proxy. Prefer it over BungeeCord or Waterfall; Waterfall is end-of-life.
- Geyser runs on the proxy as the Bedrock-to-Java protocol bridge.
- Floodgate runs on the proxy as the Bedrock identity/auth bridge, so Bedrock players can join without Java accounts.
- Java players enter on TCP 25565. Bedrock players enter on UDP 19132.
- Folia runs the lobby and survival shards.
- `survival` expands into stable VM identities: `survival-0`, `survival-1`, `survival-2`.

The Velocity/Geyser/Floodgate modules shown here are the intended API shape, not a claim that those modules all exist in this repo today. The OCI image is only the bootstrap artifact; normal updates use `switch` to activate a new NixOS system closure in place.

## Use

From this directory:

```bash
nix run .#plan -- plan      # show the resolved fleet plan
nix run .#plan -- diff      # compare desired systems with live ix state
nix run .#switch
nix run .#replace -- replace
```

`switch` snapshots and switches nodes in dependency order. Use `replace` only when VM recreation is intended.

If ix grows a first-class command wrapper, the same flow should become:

```bash
ix fleet plan
ix fleet diff
ix switch
ix replace
```
