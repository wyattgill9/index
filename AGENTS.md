# ix/images

## Workflow

Commit and push after making changes by default.

Contributor setup and local checks are in @CONTRIBUTING.md.

Work directly in the main checkout on `main` unless the user asks for a branch or separate worktree. Pull before starting, then commit and push straight to `main` after checks pass.

When a commit actually fixes a tracked GitHub issue, include an auto-closing keyword in the commit body, for example `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, or `Resolves #123`. Use `Refs #123` only for related work, policy docs, investigation, or partial cleanup that should not close the issue.

## Writing style

These rules apply to prose in docs, READMEs, comments, issues, and PR descriptions.

Do not use the "X, not Y" or "X, don't Y" rhetorical pattern. It is filler that reads as marketing. State what the thing is in a positive form, drop the contrast. Replace "ix VMs without the plumbing, not glue" with "ix VMs with services that compose." Replace "Compose, don't glue" with "Compose services."

Do not use em dashes. Write so the sentence does not need one: split into two sentences, use a colon, use parentheses, or restructure. If the urge is to insert "—", the sentence is doing two jobs and should be cut into two.

Avoid the rule of three. Tricolons like "one lockfile, one catalog, one source of truth" or "fast, cheap, reliable" read as 2024-era LLM cadence and have become cliché. By 2026 readers have shifted toward out-of-distribution phrasing with a little friction in it: uneven list lengths, unexpected concrete nouns, sentences that resolve at two beats or at four. Prefer two-part or four-part structures, mix clause lengths, and reach for a specific surprising detail instead of a third parallel slot. If a sentence falls naturally into three balanced clauses, suspect the cadence and rewrite.

Lean into small oddities. A line of prose should have one or two touches that a default LLM would not have produced: a trademark symbol on a brand name where most writers would drop it (`LEGO™`, not "Lego"), the actual proper-noun product instead of a generic synonym (`Postgres` over "a relational database"), an idiosyncratic capitalization the upstream project itself uses, a precise verb where a vague one would scan fine. The goal is texture that signals a human made specific choices, not polish that signals a model averaged its training data. Do not manufacture quirk for its own sake; let the oddity come from being more accurate, more specific, or more brand-faithful than the smooth version would be.

Other oddities worth borrowing, all downstream of one principle: commit to a specific thing rather than a smooth abstraction.

Use concrete numbers in place of qualifiers. "~67 OCI layers" beats "many layers"; "the first build takes about 40 minutes" beats "slow at first". A number commits you to having measured, and an approximate `~67` is more honest than "lots". Vague intensifiers like "robust", "scalable", "performant", or "battle-tested" commit to nothing and read as a model averaging its training data.

Anti-marketing earns trust. A short "bad fit if" or "known limitations" paragraph signals the writer has used the thing in anger and survived its failures, so the reader trusts the rest of the page. List the cases where the project is the wrong choice; name the workarounds that hurt.

Use parenthetical asides with teeth. A real-opinion clause set off in parens lets you hedge without softening. (The LEGO™ metaphor falls apart the moment two services want port 25565.) Default LLM writing either commits fully or smears the hedge across the main clause with "may sometimes"; parens admit the edge case while keeping the main assertion sharp.

Match upstream's own capitalization. `nixpkgs`, `systemd`, `ix`, `znver5`, `pnpm`. Title-casing project names as if they were normal English nouns ("Nixpkgs", "Systemd") signals the writer learned about them from a tutorial, not from the project's own README.

Name the failure mode you are claiming to avoid. "Will not crash your VM on a bad switch" is more useful than "stable"; "recovers in one rollback" beats "reliable". Failures are concrete and falsifiable. Adjectives like "stable" and "reliable" are not.

Link concrete nouns. When prose names a repo-owned tool, package, command, file, directory, or upstream project, make it a link wherever a curious reader might want to click through. The first mention of `llm-clippy` in a README should link to `packages/llm-clippy/`; `nixpkgs` links to the project; a directory pointer like `images/` links to `images/`. Anchor text is the literal name in code voice (backticks live inside the link, as `[`llm-clippy`](packages/llm-clippy/)`). Link only the first mention in a given section; do not relink the same noun every paragraph. Skip the link only when the target genuinely does not exist or when the reader is already standing on it (no self-links in the same file).

## Rust style

Prefer local type annotations over turbofish when they make the data shape clearer. For example, use `let args: Vec<_> = env::args().collect();` instead of `let args = env::args().collect::<Vec<_>>();`. Keep turbofish for cases where an expression-local type is genuinely clearer, such as method chains where naming an intermediate value would add noise.

Do not use Rust `#[path = ...]` to paper over module layout. Move files so the filesystem hierarchy matches normal `mod` declarations.

Avoid anonymous tuple-shaped domain data. Prefer named structs or full paths when a value crosses a function boundary or represents a real concept. Small local tuples are fine when the scope is obvious.

Use descriptive names as scope widens. Short loop names such as `i` or `_` are fine in a few-line scope, but use names like `path`, `bytes`, `config`, `request`, and `response` once the value survives long enough to need meaning.

Avoid parallel alias sprawl: do not create several sibling locals that repeat or flatten the same subject with different suffixes (`paperConfig`, `paperCfg`, `paperService`, `paperServiceConfig`, `gitCloneService`, `rconOpenFirewallConfig`). That is a data-clump smell. Group the subject once and nest both the root value and derived handles under it so call sites read by path instead of by duplicated names.

Be strict about preserving the conceptual path in local test fixtures and Nix `let` blocks. A binding may shorten a noisy source path only if the alias keeps the same shape: `minecraft.paper.config`, `minecraft.paper.service.unit`, `minecraft.paper.service.config`, `minecraft.rcon.openFirewall.config`, `kernelDev.git.clone.service`. Do not collapse path segments into camelCase or sibling suffixes: avoid `paperConfig`, `paperService`, `paperServiceConfig`, `rconOpenFirewallConfig`, `kernelDevGitCloneService`, and `gitCloneService`. Promote a binding to the surrounding scope only when it is genuinely independent of the owner object.

Use names like `cfg` only for the conventional Nix module option subtree (`config.services.<name>`), not as a catch-all alias for any nested value. For systemd units, keep `unit` and `config` separate under `service` (`service.unit` and `service.config`), rather than introducing `serviceConfig`.

Apply the same rule to generated files, managed paths, and fixtures. Prefer `minecraft.paper.managed.serverFiles` and `minecraft.paper.managed.dropins` over `paperManagedFiles` or `paperManagedDropins`. If the source path has meaningful segments, keep those segments visible in the alias path.

Use blank lines as paragraph breaks inside function bodies. Each paragraph should be one logical step: set up, act, then validate or return. Keep tightly coupled statements together.

For snippets in docs, comments, presets, or task descriptions that readers may see without IDE inlay hints, include explicit types on important bindings and use real repo APIs rather than invented simplified ones. In source files, use inference where it reads cleanly.

## Debugging VMs

Use the real ix CLI to inspect running VMs before inferring from source. Prefer machine-readable host commands when available, for example `ix ls --output json`.

Run guest commands with `ix shell <vm> -- <cmd> ...`. If command lookup behaves differently from an interactive shell, use absolute paths from the guest, for example `ix shell minecraft -- /run/current-system/sw/bin/journalctl --no-pager -u minecraft.service -n 80` or `ix shell minecraft -- /bin/sh -lc 'ps -ef'`.

When a debugging tool is not installed on the host or in the dev shell, run it through nixpkgs instead of hand-installing it, for example `nix run nixpkgs#jq -- --version` or `nix run nixpkgs#curl -- --version`. Put arguments after `--`.

For service failures, check the rendered unit and the live journal inside the VM. Confirm whether the unit exists, whether PID 1 is systemd, and whether the process is failing after launch before changing image/module code.

## Overview

Pre-built OCI images for ix VMs, plus composable NixOS modules. All images target AMD EPYC Gen 5 (Turin, Zen 5). The base layer sets `nixpkgs.hostPlatform.gcc.arch = "znver5"` so every package in the closure is compiled with `-march=znver5 -mtune=znver5`. No binary cache hits: everything builds from source.

## How it works

Every image is an independent NixOS system closure: `boot.isContainer = true`, systemd as PID 1, no kernel, no bootloader. `lib.mkImage` runs `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem` over the platform config (`lib/ix-platform.nix`), OCI packaging (`lib/ix-oci-layer.nix`), the module registry (`modules/`), and any caller modules, then packages the toplevel into an OCI archive via the nixpkgs layer planner plus the repo's direct OCI archive builder (`lib/build-oci-image.sh`).

Images are not stacked at runtime. ix runs one image. Layering is purely a build-time concern: the closure is split into ~67 OCI layers so the registry stores each shared store path once and clients only pay for deltas. Single-layer would force every image to ship a private copy of the multi-hundred-MB base closure.

## VM assumptions

ix VMs implicitly have snapshots and effectively unbounded disk. Fleet and stateful-service designs should lean on those primitives: take snapshots before destructive or data-format-changing operations, prefer in-place NixOS/system switches for stateful nodes, and do not design around fixed-root-disk exhaustion as a primary constraint.

## Trust model

Assume the agent running inside a VM has root and a goal it is optimizing for. It can install packages, edit `/etc`, restart services, flip `networking.firewall.enable`, and overwrite anything reachable from inside the guest. What it does not have by default: host API credentials, the ix CLI's host-side authority, registry-write tokens, or any secret you do not mount in. Design follows from that asymmetry. Anything that must hold against a misbehaving in-VM process belongs outside the VM, where the agent cannot reach it.

Concrete shapes this principle produces:

- **Network policy.** In-VM `networking.firewall.*` is convenience for a cooperative guest. The guest can disable it, so it is not a containment boundary. When a port must stay closed against a rogue guest, the enforcement point is a separate router/gateway VM the agent has no shell on, or one of ix's group/internet primitives. Inline `networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts` is still the right place to *declare* intent (co-located with the service that needs the port); the enforcing layer reads that intent from outside.
- **Secrets.** Long-lived credentials (API keys, registry-write tokens, cloud creds) stay on the host or in a sibling VM that does not share a kernel with the agent. Mount only the short-lived, narrowly-scoped material the agent needs for the current task.
- **Snapshot and rollback authority.** The operator owns snapshot/rollback. An agent that can `ix snapshot` its own VM can paper over destructive behavior, so that surface belongs on the host side.
- **Image and switch-source authority.** The agent should not be able to switch its own VM to an unsigned or unreviewed image, or rewrite the source the VM was built from. That capability lives with the operator.

The "VM networking" section below is one specialization of this principle. Apply the same lens whenever a new feature lands: "if a rogue agent in this VM tried to subvert this, where does the rule actually live?"

## VM networking

Networking policy lives in the image, not in ix. ix exposes two primitives: VM group membership (east-west, which VMs can reach each other) and internet ingress/egress on or off (north-south, per direction). Per-port filtering, L7 rules, WAF, rate limiting, and mTLS termination belong in the image's NixOS config (`networking.firewall.*`, services in front of the workload) or in a user-built gateway VM. Do not push port allowlists or L7 features into ix; the matching rule on the ix side is recorded in `ix/AGENTS.md` under "Architecture that must not drift". If a service needs only some ports exposed, declare it in the image with `networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts` or front it with a gateway VM. Treat in-image firewall config as cooperative-guest intent per the trust model above: if the policy must hold against a rogue agent inside the same VM, the enforcement layer must live on a separate gateway/router VM the agent cannot reach.

## Registry access

Do not assume every `registry.ix.dev` image is public. The `ix` namespace is system-owned, so shared bootstrap refs such as `registry.ix.dev/ix/test-cluster-bootstrap:<tag>` are expected to be public. User images live under `registry.ix.dev/<username>/<image>:<tag>` and default to private; private images require the owner’s auth and should behave like not-found for other users. When debugging image pulls, distinguish a public system bootstrap image from a user-owned private image before treating access as a registry outage.

The shared fleet bootstrap image is defined at `images/system/test-cluster-bootstrap`. It is an ordinary image that extends the repo base profile; keep source-switch tools such as `gnutar`, `zstd`, and `gzip` in `modules/profiles/base.nix` so any VM that has been switched once can be switched again. Build the bootstrap with `nix build .#test-cluster-bootstrap --print-out-paths --no-link`; upload it only with an admin ix profile, using an explicit system namespace ref such as `ix image push <archive>.tar registry.ix.dev/ix/test-cluster-bootstrap:<tag>`. TODO: replace full payload uploads with CAS/CDC-aware transfer for both bootstrap image publishing and `ix switch --source`, so routine updates send only changed chunks and then update the registry or switch input reference.

## Flake.nix style

`flake.nix` is the repo's handle. It should read like a manifest: a small inputs block and an `outputs` body that is mostly delegation. All logic lives in `./lib/` or behind discovery (`ix.discoverImages`). The goal is that someone landing on `flake.nix` cold can answer "what does this flake expose?" by skimming, not by parsing.

Do not put inside `flake.nix`:

- Fetched-artifact URLs. They are data, not flake-graph participants; keep URL + SRI hash beside the catalog entry and call `pkgs.fetchurl` at use.
- App wrapper definitions (`writeNushellApplication { ... }` for `lint`, `update-mods`, `ix-fleet`, demo wrappers, etc.). Define them in a dedicated module under `./lib/` and reference them from `outputs` by name.
- Per-system `let`-bindings that compose many helpers. Push the composition into a single `mkOutputs system` function in `./lib/` and call it from `lib.genAttrs devSystems`.
- Image preset or demo wiring (`claudeCodeDemoFor`, per-VM wrappers, etc.). Move into the preset's own `default.nix` and import it once.

Target: `flake.nix` fits comfortably in a single screen and its body would look almost unsurprising as JSON. The cost of an inline helper today is the year-from-now untangle. Pay the structure cost up front.

Flake outputs stay on the standard schema: `packages`, `apps`, `checks`, `formatter`, `devShells`, `templates`, `overlays`, `nixosModules`, `lib`. Use `nixosModules` (plural, namespaced) for module exports. Do not add a flat top-level `modules` key: it is non-standard, not validated by `nix flake check`, and may not be discovered by downstream tooling.

## Adding an image

Drop a NixOS module at `images/<category>/<name>/default.nix`. That's it: discovery picks it up on the next eval and exposes `packages.<host>.<name>` for the supported dev systems. The derivation still targets `x86_64-linux`. No flake edits, no registry edits.

For a versioned image (multiple variants ship at once), add a `versions.nix` sibling:

```nix
{ lib, ... }:
let
  default = "1.21.11-fabric";
  variants = {
    "1.21.11-fabric" = {
      loader = "fabric";
      version = "1.21.11";
      mods = [ "fabric-api" "spark" ];
    };
  };
in
{
  inherit default;
}
// lib.mapAttrs (tag: { loader, version, mods }: {
  ix.image.tag = tag;
  services.minecraft = {
    inherit version;
    mods = lib.genAttrs mods (_: { });
    ${loader}.enable = true;
  };
}) variants
```

Discovery then exposes `<name>_<ver>` for each version key plus `<name>` as an alias for the `default` version.

## Adding a module

Drop the file at `modules/services/<name>.nix` (or `modules/profiles/<name>.nix`) and register it in `modules/default.nix`. Keep modules independent: declare `options`, gate everything behind `mkIf cfg.enable`, never import another module. The registry exists so option sets are visible to every image; modules stay inert until their `enable` flag is set.

## Service families

When several modules vary along one axis (e.g. minecraft + fabric/paper/vanilla loaders), put the runtime in `modules/services/<name>/default.nix` and each variant in `modules/services/<name>/<variant>.nix`. The runtime declares a "slot" option; variants fill it. Wire each file into `modules/default.nix` as a separate registry entry.

For minecraft this means:
- `services.minecraft.serverJar` is the slot, declared by the runtime.
- Each loader module (fabric, folia, neoforge, paper, purpur, spigot, sponge, vanilla) sets `services.minecraft.serverJar` from its own URL/version options.
- Enabling a loader auto-enables the runtime via `mkDefault`.
- Enabling two loaders is a module-merge conflict → loud eval error.

## Mods

All mods go in `services.minecraft.mods`, keyed by Modrinth slug. Empty `{}` includes the jar with defaults. Attrsets with fields configure the mod.

```nix
services.minecraft.mods = {
  fabric-api = {};
  lithium = {};
  distanthorizons.maxRenderDistance = 512;
};
```

The `modCatalog` option maps slugs to locked artifact sources. Set by the image base (from `common.json`) and version overlays (from `<version>.json`), then enriched through `ix.artifacts.attachArtifactSources`, which wraps each catalog entry's `{ url, hash }` in a `pkgs.fetchurl` derivation. The runtime resolves every key in `mods` to that derivation's store path.

### Minecraft artifact catalog generation

The canonical Minecraft artifact catalog generator is `tools/update-mods.py`, exposed as `nix run .#update-mods`. For Fabric/NeoForge/Sponge mods, edit `images/games/minecraft/mods/manifest.json`, then run the app to regenerate `common.json`, the per-version lock catalogs, and the rich metadata catalog under `metadata/catalog.json`. For Paper plugins, edit `images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json`, then run `nix run .#update-mods -- --manifest images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json`. For one game version, pass `--version <version>`.

Modrinth-hosted entries should be listed by slug so the generator owns URL and hash selection. When a Bukkit plugin's runtime name differs from the slug, set `pluginName` in the manifest so PlugMan reloads use the correct name. Non-Modrinth or hand-picked artifacts belong in the manifest as a small object with the slug and URL; the generated catalog is where `{ url, hash }` belongs. Do not hand-edit the generated JSON except to inspect a diff before committing.

Use manifest `searches` for broad agent-queryable indexes such as popular Fabric mods or Paper-compatible server plugins. Search results enrich `metadata/catalog.json` with descriptions, project pages, icons, gallery images, links, selected version files, and dependency metadata without adding every discovered artifact to `services.minecraft.mods` or `services.minecraft.plugins`. Keep the per-version lock catalogs curated; they are the install set that Nix consumes.

### Mod modules

Mods with config files get a NixOS module at `modules/services/minecraft/mods/<name>.nix`. The module activates when `services.minecraft.mods.<slug>` is present, reads the user's attrset (with defaults), and generates `configFiles`.

```nix
# modules/services/minecraft/mods/distant-horizons.nix
{ config, lib, ... }:
let
  modCfg = config.services.minecraft.mods.distanthorizons or null;
  defaults = { serverSideLodGeneration = true; maxRenderDistance = 256; };
  merged = defaults // (if modCfg == null then {} else modCfg);
in
{
  config = lib.mkIf (modCfg != null) {
    services.minecraft.configFiles."DistantHorizons.toml" = {
      server = { inherit (merged) serverSideLodGeneration maxRenderDistance; };
    };
  };
}
```

Mods without config (lithium, krypton, chunky) do not need a module. The slug in `mods` is sufficient. Register mod modules in `modules/default.nix` under `minecraft.mods.<name>`.

### Minecraft player access

Whitelist and operator files are derived from `services.minecraft.players`. Put each player's UUID and optional display name there, then set `whitelist = true` and/or `operator.enable = true` on the player. Use `services.minecraft.whitelist.enable` for `server.properties` whitelist enforcement. Presets and examples must not hand-author `ops.json` or `whitelist.json`; those are mutable server-state files, so ix reconciles a Nix-managed subset at runtime and preserves entries that were not previously managed by Nix.

### Config file format inference

`services.minecraft.properties` writes `server.properties`, and `services.minecraft.worlds.<name>.generator` renders Bukkit world generator bindings into `bukkit.yml`. Use those first-class options in images, presets, and examples; keep `services.minecraft.bukkit` and `serverFiles` as escape hatches for less common root files. `configFiles` keys are relative paths under `config/`. The serialization format is inferred from the file extension: `.toml`, `.json`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, `.properties`. Values are plain Nix attrsets. Mod modules never import `pkgs.formats` directly.

```nix
services.minecraft.properties.motd = "ix-powered Minecraft";
services.minecraft.worlds.factions.generator = "TerraformGenerator";
services.minecraft.configFiles."SomeMod.toml" = { section.key = "value"; };
services.minecraft.configFiles."other.yml" = { setting = true; };
```

### Writable vs read-only configs

Config files are symlinked to the Nix store (read-only). Some mods write to their config at runtime. If a mod needs a writable config, the mod module should copy instead of symlink. This is not yet implemented but is a known gap (see nix-minecraft's `files` vs `symlinks` pattern for reference).

## Cross-cutting helpers (`specialArgs.ix`)

Helpers shared across modules go in `lib/` and are exposed to every module through `specialArgs.ix`. Modules consume them as ordinary module args:

```nix
# modules/services/minecraft/paper.nix
{ ix, config, lib, ... }:
ix.mkMinecraftLoader {
  inherit config lib;
  name = "paper";
  dropinDir = "plugins";
  extraOptions = { /* loader-specific options */ };
}
```

This is the only way modules in this repo reach helpers in `lib/`. **Never** use `../` or `../../` paths to climb out of `modules/`. Relative-path imports between modules and lib break the abstraction (modules become coupled to lib's filesystem layout) and make module files harder to relocate. If a helper needs to be shared, expose it through `specialArgs.ix`. The helper bundle is also part of the public flake `lib` output, so external users get the same surface.

## Doc-comments

Public helpers exposed through the flake `lib` output and through `specialArgs.ix` use `/** ... */` doc-comments placed immediately before the binding (RFC 0145). CommonMark inside. Document the API: what the helper does, the shape of its arguments, and the shape of its return. Implementation-only `#` comments stay for the "why" notes the rest of this document covers; doc-comments are the API surface. When adding a new helper next to a file with a single top-of-file block comment, lift the relevant prose into per-binding doc-comments.

```nix
/**
Build one self-contained OCI archive from a list of NixOS modules.

Runs `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem` over the platform config, OCI packaging, the
module registry, and any caller modules, then streams the toplevel into an
OCI archive. Returns the archive derivation.
*/
mkImage = args: (evalImageConfig args).ix.build.ociImage;
```

## Module conventions

- Modules declare options and config. They never `imports` another module.
- Top-level options live under `services.<name>` for services, `ix.profiles.<name>` for profiles. Never reach into another module's namespace.
- Everything in `config` is wrapped in `mkIf cfg.enable`. The base profile is the only exception: it ships an enable flag so users can opt out.
- Module options take strings, paths, or packages — not factory arguments. Versioning belongs in `versions.nix`, not in a function wrapping the module.
- Public option names should describe the user's domain, not the storage mechanism. Prefer `services.minecraft.plugins` for Bukkit-family plugins and `services.minecraft.mods` for Fabric/NeoForge/Sponge mods; avoid vague plumbing names such as `extraJars` or `dropins` unless the storage mechanism is itself the concept.
- Cross-module helpers come from `specialArgs.ix`. No `..` paths.
- Modules that render a structured config file expose typed settings backed by `pkgs.formats.*` with a freeform submodule (RFC 0042). The repo's `services.minecraft.configFiles` slot is the canonical pattern: keys are relative file paths, values are plain attrsets, and the format is inferred from the extension. Do not introduce stringly `extraConfig` options on new modules; concatenating strings can't merge same-key assignments, defeats `mkDefault`/`mkForce`, and makes values uninspectable.

## Path boundaries

Relative-up paths (`../`, `../../`, etc.) are usually an anti-pattern in tracked Nix code. They couple a file to a caller's current location instead of to the repo API boundary. Prefer named package sets, flake inputs, module options, or helpers exposed through `specialArgs.ix`. If a file needs something outside its directory tree, first ask which boundary should own that dependency and expose it there.

Relative paths to children or siblings inside the same package/module directory are fine. Relative-up paths are acceptable only when they are local, standard for the tool or ecosystem, and not reaching across a repo layer. The smell is climbing upward to reach across layers such as `images/` -> `packages/`, `modules/` -> `lib/`, or presets -> repo internals.

## Plugin conventions

Bukkit-family loaders (Paper, Folia, Purpur, Spigot) use `services.minecraft.plugins`. Empty `{}` resolves a pinned plugin by slug from `pluginCatalog`; an attrset with `src` installs a local or private plugin jar; other attrset fields are reserved for plugin-specific modules such as `services.minecraft.plugins.simple-voice-chat.port`. The repo's plugin and mod catalogs (`ix.lib.artifacts.minecraft.*`, the generated JSON catalogs under `images/games/minecraft/mods/` and `images/games/minecraft/plugins/`) are the shared surface that presets, examples, and images consume. Presets and examples must not inline plugin or mod URLs and hashes; see the "Presets never own artifact data" rule under Image preset conventions.

When a plugin has required companion config, model that as a module activated by the plugin slug instead of making every consumer hand-write sidecar files. For example, `services.minecraft.plugins.terraformgenerator.worlds = [ "factions" "factions_nether" "factions_the_end" ];` should contribute matching `services.minecraft.worlds.<name>.generator` defaults, which the runtime renders to `bukkit.yml`.

Fabric/NeoForge/Sponge-style artifacts stay in `services.minecraft.mods`. Keep mod and plugin catalogs near the image/module artifact plumbing, not in preset fleets. Preset fleets should read like intent: choose a server, select catalog plugins/mods by slug, and show local/private artifacts only when that is the point of the preset.

Paper plugin artifacts are generated from `images/games/minecraft/plugins/paper/manifest.json` into `ix.artifacts.minecraft.paperPluginCatalogs.<version>`. Loader modules seed `services.minecraft.pluginCatalog` from that versioned catalog, with `ix.artifacts.minecraft.paperPluginCatalog` kept as the current default alias. Add shared Paper plugins through the manifest and generator, not by hand-editing `lib/default.nix`.

## Image conventions

- Images set `ix.image.name`. They may set `ix.image.tag` (defaults to `latest`, or comes from `versions.nix`).
- Images compose by enabling services and adding packages. They do not declare options. They do not `imports` anything.
- Images stay version-agnostic when they have a `versions.nix`. The base file is what every variant shares; per-version data lives in the overlay.
- Use a single `services.<name>` block per service. Nest sub-options inside attrsets instead of writing scattered dotted assignments. Prefer `services.minecraft = { plugins = { luckperms = { }; claude-code-scoreboard = { ... }; }; };` over separate `services.minecraft.plugins.luckperms = { };` lines in presets.
- Options that are redundant with their namespace should be shortened. `services.minecraft.folia.version`, not `services.minecraft.folia.minecraftVersion`.
- Images should consume repo-local packages through `ix.packages`, not by importing `../../..` paths into `packages/`. Keep source-path ownership in the package set, following nixpkgs' `callPackage`/package-set style: modules and images choose package values, while package definitions own their filesystem layout.

## DRY user-facing options

Every fact a user states in `config` should appear once. Apply this strictly when designing or extending a module, library, or helper: if a typical preset sets `services.foo.version = "1.2.3"` and then also writes `services.foo.src = artifacts.foo."1.2.3"` and `services.foo.modCatalog = catalogs."1.2.3"`, the API is wrong. Restructure so the version drives the derived defaults and the preset only mentions `1.2.3` once.

Three failure modes that justify a restructure:

- **Duplicated identifiers.** The same string appears in two or more option assignments in a typical config. Declare one canonical option (the version, hostname, slug, region) and have the rest default off it. Cross-option defaults (option B reads option A) are how you express derivation; use `defaultText` so the manual still shows the intent.
- **Per-call-site defaults.** Every caller writes the same `src = artifacts.foo.X;` line. Move the default onto the option (`default = artifacts.foo.X;`) so callers only override the exception. The library is where reachable defaults live; the preset chooses among them by name.
- **Cargo-cult options.** A module declares `services.foo.bar.flavor` but no `config` block ever reads it. Delete the option. Forcing presets to set a value that nothing consumes is worse than not having the option, because it tricks readers into thinking the value matters.

Presets are the API's specification. Write the preset first; if a single intent ("use Paper 1.21.11") takes more than one line, the option set is too wide. A verbose preset is a bug in the module's API, not in the preset. The "Presets never own artifact data" rule below is the library-side complement: keep artifact data in `ix.lib.*` so presets can stay this short.

The repo has no external consumers, so renaming or collapsing options is free. Pay the migration cost (callers, tests, docs) in the same change.

## Image preset conventions

Image presets live under `images/presets/`. They are teaching material, not just tests: each preset should be a runnable image or fleet shape that composes the repo's normal modules, packages, and artifact catalogs by name. Add short comments for ix-specific ideas that a first-time reader will not infer from Nix alone: `deployment.switch.overrideInputs`, remote switch builds, fleet defaults, hot-reload behavior, and why an image name or tag is set.

Examples and presets should make the backing API look good. If an example needs to repeat obvious safe defaults, conservative service settings, artifact plumbing, or boilerplate just to be production-shaped, fix the module/helper defaults instead and keep the consumer minimal. The example should show intent; the library should carry the policy.

### Presets never own artifact data

Presets must not inline URLs, hashes, or pinned version strings for fetched artifacts. Mod jars, plugin jars, server jars, datasets, JDKs, and source-fetched packages all live in the repo's library surface (`ix.lib.artifacts.*`, `ix.packages`, module options, generated catalogs under `images/`), and presets consume them by name. If a preset needs an artifact the library does not expose yet, extend the library first: add the slug to the relevant catalog and regenerate it with `nix run .#update-mods`, add a new entry to `ix.lib.artifacts`, or grow the relevant module option. Then point the preset at the named surface. Presets are consumer tests for whether the library is sufficiently specified. A missing entry is a gap in the repo; fix it in the library so every consumer benefits.

In-repo presets that exercise this repo's library, modules, fleets, or pinned artifacts should be exposed from the root `flake.nix` as `apps`/`packages` and share the root `flake.lock`. Keep the actual fleet or image value in the preset's `default.nix` so tests and root outputs can import it. Do not add a nested preset `flake.lock` that pins this same repo; it will drift from the API under test.

Use a standalone template or `examples/<name>` flake only when it is intentionally a downstream consumer. In that case its inputs should look like a real external user's inputs (`github:indexable-inc/index`, registry refs, etc.), not `path:../..` or `git+file:../..` backedges into the parent checkout. Do not add template-local artifact inputs when the root flake already exposes the locked artifact through `ix.lib.artifacts`.

In fleet presets, `ix.image.name` usually defaults to the node name. Set it only when the replacement image should be named differently. Set `ix.image.tag` when the default `latest` would make plans or registry destinations ambiguous.

Comments should explain why a line exists, not restate Nix syntax. Prefer comments that answer "why is this needed in an ix fleet?" over comments that paraphrase the option name.

Default to Rust for repo-owned tools that parse structured data, reconcile mutable state, stream archives, move large byte ranges, implement nontrivial CLIs, or sit in build/runtime hot paths. In practice, the vast majority of new first-party tooling with real logic should be Rust with normal source files, Cargo metadata, tests where useful, and Nix packaging. Shell is fine for small orchestration around existing programs, and Python is fine for low-volume generators or ecosystem-heavy tasks such as catalog updates, but do not leave stateful reconcilers, performance-sensitive builders, or runtime helpers in Python merely because it is quick to prototype.

Prefer structured encoders at the boundary that owns the data. For JSON, YAML, TOML, properties files, and test fixtures, use Nix values with `pkgs.formats.*` or a language-native serializer, then copy or link the generated file from the shell step. Keep shell focused on orchestration: arranging directories, invoking tools, and checking outputs. This keeps escaping, ordering, and encoding consistent, and makes the data shape reviewable as Nix or typed source instead of as heredoc text.

When reasoning about build performance, assume package dependencies are already cached unless the question is specifically about bootstrap or cold-cache behavior. Treat Rust crates, Python dependencies, and other toolchain inputs like nixpkgs does: they are expected to be prebuilt/substituted in normal use, so benchmark the repo-owned derivation or image assembly path after dependencies are present.

To measure build time, prefer `time -p nix build .#<attr> --rebuild --print-out-paths --no-link` for the derivation under investigation. Use `--log-format internal-json -v` when you need structured Nix events, and `-L` when builder logs matter. For image assembly specifically, compare cached top-level rebuilds so dependency fetching and unrelated invalidations do not hide the packaging cost.

Use the ecosystem's normal project shape before inventing local scaffolding. Java support projects should be Maven or Gradle projects with a `pom.xml`/build file, `src/main/java`, and resources; build them from Nix with `maven.buildMavenPackage` or the corresponding standard builder. Do not generate source files from Nix heredocs, vendor fake API stubs, or hand-roll classpaths when a normal build tool dependency is available.

Web support projects should use ordinary frontend project structure too. Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript, split real UI into components/modules once a single file stops being clearer, and keep strict typechecking and ESLint in the default build path. For Svelte/Vite projects, `npm run build` should run `svelte-check`, ESLint, and the production bundle so `buildNpmPackage` enforces the same checks as local development. Use SvelteKit only when the project needs routes, server-side loading, endpoint handlers, or an app runtime; static status pages can stay Svelte/Vite.

Do not hide real source files inside Nix strings just to keep the file count small. If a preset needs Java, scripts, config templates, or assets, put them in ordinary files with normal paths and keep the Nix derivation as the build recipe. Inline generated files are acceptable only for tiny machine-owned glue where reading a separate file would be worse.

At the same time, do not spray files around without a boundary. Group support code under a named subdirectory with a small `default.nix`, source files, and assets it needs. Reusable server code, plugins, and other composable artifacts belong under `packages/<family>/...`; image directories should compose those artifacts, not own unrelated build projects.

For self-contained support projects, filter at the project boundary instead of listing every source file. Prefer `lib.fileset.intersection (lib.fileset.gitTracked ./.) ./.` in the project-local `default.nix` so new tracked files under `src/`, `resources/`, Gradle metadata, or similar project-owned paths are included automatically while untracked build caches stay out of the store. Use explicit file lists only when the derivation intentionally consumes a small cross-cutting subset.

## Artifact inputs

Fetched artifacts (mod jars, server jars, plugins, source trees) belong at the point of use, not as flake inputs. Use a `pkgs.*` fetcher with an inline SRI hash kept beside the source in the per-image catalog (`images/games/minecraft/mods/*.json` or the image's own data file). The `flake.nix` inputs list is reserved for things that genuinely participate in the flake graph: `nixpkgs` and tooling flakes that expose `lib`, `overlays`, or `packages`. A static URL is not a flake input. It is data, and data lives next to the code that reads it.

Pick the most specific `pkgs.*` fetcher for the source. `pkgs.fetchurl` is right for opaque single-file downloads (jars, zips, tarballs hosted at a stable URL). For source trees, prefer the upstream-specific fetcher so the derivation captures the right metadata and so future bumps go through one well-known field: `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`, `pkgs.fetchFromGitLab`, `pkgs.fetchFromForgejo`, and friends for forge tarballs; `pkgs.fetchgit` for raw git refs; `pkgs.fetchzip` for archives that should be unpacked; `pkgs.fetchMavenArtifact`, `pkgs.fetchNpmDeps`, `pkgs.fetchCrate` for ecosystem artifacts. Do not use `builtins.fetchurl`, `builtins.fetchTarball`, `builtins.fetchGit`, or `builtins.fetchTree` in tracked Nix files: those run on eval, are not fixed-output derivations, do not substitute from a binary cache, and are banned in nixpkgs. The `pkgs.*` fetchers are (optionally) fixed-output derivations and only fetch at build time.

Earlier versions of this repo tracked every mod jar as a non-flake `inputs.artifact-*` URL so that `flake.lock` would own each `narHash`. That made `flake.nix` unreadable and centralized nothing useful: each entry still had to be edited individually, and the lock file became a churn-heavy diff for every routine mod bump. Prefer URL + SRI hash next to the catalog entry; the update tooling (`nix run .#update-mods`) regenerates both fields together.

Tracked Nix files must not contain `lib.fakeHash`, `lib.fakeSha256`, `lib.fakeSha512`, or placeholder hashes such as `sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=`. Compute the real SRI hash before committing (e.g. `nix store prefetch-file --json <url> | jq -r .hash`) and store it with the URL.

## Target platform

All images run on AMD EPYC Gen 5 (Turin, Zen 5). `lib/ix-platform.nix` sets `nixpkgs.hostPlatform.gcc.arch = "znver5"` and `tune = "znver5"`, which propagates `-march=znver5 -mtune=znver5` to every package in the closure. This enables AVX-512, VNNI, and other Zen 5 instructions across the board.

Because the arch differs from the nixpkgs binary cache (generic x86_64), every package builds from source. This is intentional: these images run on known hardware and the build cost is paid once.

When adding new modules or packages, do not override compiler flags per-package. The base layer handles it globally. If a package needs arch-specific tuning beyond compiler flags (e.g. PostgreSQL `huge_pages`, JVM `-XX:+UseAVX`), set those in the module.

## Nix philosophy

- **Single source of truth.** `modules/default.nix` is the only place modules are listed; `lib.collect` derives the flat list from the nested attrset. Versions live next to the image in `versions.nix`, not in `flake.nix`. Hashes live next to URLs.
- **No backwards compat.** This repo is young and has no external consumers. Rename freely, change signatures, delete dead code. No shims, no aliases, no `// removed` comments, no feature flags for the old way. Update callers in the same change.
- **Auto-discover, don't enumerate.** `flake.nix` walks `images/`. Adding an image is `mkdir + edit one file`. Hand-wired registries rot.
- **DRY at the data layer, not the abstraction layer.** `inherit (pkgs) ...` over a wrapper helper. `lib.collect` over a parallel list. Don't introduce a function unless it has at least two callers; the minecraft-loader helper qualifies because eight loaders share the same shape.
- **Comments explain why, not what.** Headers say what each file is for and what's load-bearing (e.g. `maxLayers = 67` with the registry-cap rationale, base profile auto-enabled). Don't restate what the code obviously does.
- **Trust module merging.** Layer per-version overlays via the module system, not by passing args to factory functions. Service families (runtime + variants) compose through option slots, not through wrappers.
- **Pure eval.** No `builtins.currentSystem`, no `builtins.getEnv`, no `<nixpkgs>` channel refs, no `path:` flake refs. Every input flows through `flake.nix`.
- **IFD is allowed when it removes a fake Nix layer.** Import From Derivation is acceptable for builders that first need another tool to reveal the real build graph, such as Cargo unit graphs. Keep the IFD boundary explicit and inspectable by exposing the generated artifact. The assumption is that this repo targets Nix implementations where IFD does not pin the main evaluator thread long-term: either mainline Nix gets good enough here, or evaluators such as snix keep advancing their existing support. Do not contort dynamic tool output into hand-maintained Nix data just to avoid IFD.
- **Strict, named failures.** `lib.assertMsg` over bare `assert`. Required options have no default so misuse fails at eval with the option name. Two loaders enabled → module-merge conflict, not silently-last-wins.
- **Test useful invariants.** Eval tests should protect behavior that can regress across module boundaries, generated units, fleet rendering, artifact wiring, or security/runtime contracts. Do not assert facts that are already obvious from the same literal config being imported, such as exact preset node names, hand-copied package allowlists from auto-discovery, or every field in a preset's own `server.properties`. Flake evaluation already catches syntax and missing-output failures; tests should add signal beyond that.

## Nix practices to tighten

These are current repo habits that should not become defaults. When touching nearby code, improve the pattern in the same change. If the cleanup is wider than the task, file a narrow issue.

- **Typed module interfaces.** Avoid `types.attrs`, `types.attrsOf types.attrs`, and `types.anything` for domain data. Use `types.submodule`, `attrsOf (submodule ...)`, `types.enum`, `types.oneOf`, `types.nullOr`, or a `pkgs.formats.*.type` that matches the file being generated. Keep broad attrs only at true foreign-format boundaries, and name that boundary in the option description.
- **Filtered local sources.** Do not default to broad `src = ./project` or `src = ./site` inputs. Use `lib.fileset.toSource` with the smallest useful file set, usually `lib.fileset.intersection (lib.fileset.gitTracked ./.) (lib.fileset.unions [ ... ])`, or `lib.sources.cleanSourceWith` when a predicate is clearer. This avoids copying irrelevant files or secrets into the store and prevents rebuilds from unrelated local changes.
- **Executable paths.** Prefer `lib.getExe pkg` when the package's `meta.mainProgram` is correct, and `lib.getExe' pkg "program"` when the executable name is intentionally explicit. Add `meta.mainProgram` to repo packages that install a primary binary. Avoid scattering `"${pkg}/bin/foo"` through systemd units, apps, tests, and scripts unless there is no package value to pass around.
- **Checked builders.** Repo helpers that generate commands should run the strongest practical build-time validation by default, and callers should reuse those helpers instead of open-coding ad hoc wrappers. Examples: `ix.writeNushellApplication` runs Nu diagnostics, and `ix.writePythonApplication` runs basedpyright with required types. Keep the policy generic: add or extend one DRY helper when a language/tool needs validation, then use it everywhere.
- **Fix the improper layer.** If an idiomatic cleanup exposes that the underlying helper, package, or tool is not proper, fix that layer in the same change instead of weakening validation or adding a local workaround. Only narrow the check when the stricter mode exposes unrelated legacy debt, and leave the tool on the strongest mode it currently satisfies.
- **Shell applications.** Use `ix.writeNushellApplication pkgs { ... }` for generated commands that call other programs, so runtime dependencies are explicit and Nu syntax is checked during the build. Do not use `writeShellApplication` or `writeShellScriptBin` in tracked Nix files. Tiny `writeShellScript` glue is acceptable only when the output is not a user-facing command.
- **Nushell wrappers.** Keep wrappers real Nu, not Bash hidden inside a Nu string. Use `def main [...args]`, structured values, lists with `...$args`, and `builtins.toJSON` for Nix-to-Nu literals. The wrapper helper must prepend declared runtime inputs while preserving the ambient `PATH`; fleet/app wrappers may need commands supplied by the caller, such as a freshly patched `ix` binary.
- **Scripts.** Prefer Nushell (`.nu`) over Bash for new non-trivial repo scripts, especially when the script parses JSON, builds structured output, or has enough branching that shell quoting becomes load-bearing. Package these scripts with `ix.writeNushellApplication pkgs { ... }` so runtime dependencies are explicit and Nu syntax is checked during the build. Bash is fine for tiny POSIX-style wrappers.
- **devShells.** Default to no devShell. Most of what people reach for one to do can be done without one. Env vars and PATH-bound tools belong in `.envrc` (direnv handles its own bootstrapping; do not wrap direnv in a `shellHook`). Editor-only tools (LSPs, formatters) belong in your editor config. A package that is genuinely required at build time belongs in that package's `nativeBuildInputs`. Per-package shells already exist: `nix develop nixpkgs#hello` enters `pkgs.hello`'s build environment, and `nix develop .#<package>` does the same for repo packages. The only place a `devShells.default` carries its weight is the unified-shell case: when you're regularly working across many of the repo's own packages and want one entry point, build it with `inputsFrom = [ pkg1 pkg2 ... ]` instead of accumulating a junk drawer in `mkShell.packages`.
- **Pre-commit.** Do not depend on the `cachix/git-hooks.nix` framework when a one-line hook does the job. Use `.githooks/pre-commit` (chmod +x) that runs `nix flake check` or `nix run .#lint`, and have `.envrc` set `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 / GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath / GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=./.githooks`. The lint app is the single source of truth; flake checks reuse it.

## Nix style (ast-grep enforced)

Run `nix run .#lint` before committing. It runs `nixfmt`, `statix`, `deadnix`, and the repo's ast-grep rules. Hard rules:

- No `with pkgs;` or `with lib;`. Use `inherit (pkgs) ...` or `lib.foo` directly.
- No `rec { }`. Use `let ... in` or `final/prev` instead.
- No `mkForce`. Resolve conflicts with priority composition or fix the module boundary.
- No `lib.recursiveUpdate`. Build the attrset in one place or use `lib.mkMerge`.
- No repeated parent keys in the same attrset. Group related assignments under one parent, e.g. `services.minecraft = { ...; };` or `environment.etc = { ...; };`, instead of several `services.minecraft.foo = ...;` lines in the same attrset.
- Prefer `inherit (source) name;` for direct field copies when the local name is the same. Avoid `name = source.name;` unless the assignment is clearer because it transforms or documents a boundary.
- No `builtins.currentSystem`, `builtins.getEnv`, `<nixpkgs>`, or `path:` flake refs.
- No `(import ./foo.nix)` inside `imports = [ ... ]`. NixOS auto-imports paths.
- No `..` paths inside `modules/`. Cross-cutting helpers come through `specialArgs.ix`.
- No `writeShellApplication` or `writeShellScriptBin`. Use `ix.writeNushellApplication pkgs { ... }` for user-facing commands and orchestrators.
- No bare `assert cond;`. Use `assert lib.assertMsg cond "why";`.
- No unused bindings. Use `_` for intentionally unused lambda arguments, remove unused module args, and run `deadnix --fail --no-lambda-pattern-names .` through `nix run .#lint`.
- `strictDeps = true` on every `mkDerivation`. `__structuredAttrs` is the nixpkgs default; do not set it explicitly.
- No artifact URLs in `flake.nix` inputs. Fetched assets (jars, plugins, server tarballs, source trees) go through a `pkgs.*` fetcher at point of use with the URL/ref and SRI hash held next to the catalog entry. Flake inputs are for flake-graph participants only (`nixpkgs`, tooling flakes).
- No `builtins.fetchurl`, `builtins.fetchTarball`, `builtins.fetchGit`, or `builtins.fetchTree` in tracked Nix files. Use the matching `pkgs.*` fetcher (`pkgs.fetchurl`, `pkgs.fetchzip`, `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`/`pkgs.fetchgit`, etc.) so the fetch is a fixed-output derivation that can substitute from the cache.
- No fake hash helpers or placeholder hashes in tracked Nix files. Compute the real SRI hash first.
- No flat top-level `modules` flake output. Use `nixosModules.<name>` (standard schema) for module exports.
- Image target is x86_64-linux only. Host-visible flake package namespaces may include developer systems such as aarch64-darwin, but they should point at the same Linux image derivations rather than changing the image target.
- No stringly `extraConfig` / `extraSettings` options on new modules (RFC 0042). Structured config goes through `pkgs.formats.*` with a freeform submodule; the repo's `configFiles` slot is the canonical path.

## Issues

Keep issue bodies short. State the problem, the context, and the desired outcome. For bug reports, include a `To reproduce` section with the concrete command or steps that exposed the failure. Don't prescribe implementation steps or extra section headers unless explicitly asked.

When creating or editing GitHub issue bodies or comments, pass multiline text through a real multiline input path such as `--body-file -`, a temporary file, or an editor. Do not put escaped `\n` sequences inside a quoted `--body` string; they render literally on GitHub instead of becoming paragraph breaks.

When you hit a real bug, broken assumption, or unidiomatic pattern while working in this repo, file a GitHub issue right then (`gh issue create -R indexable-inc/index ...`). Don't batch and don't wait to be asked. One concrete observation per issue.

## Tests

Image and reusable package derivations expose their tests through `passthru.tests.<name>` (RFC 0119). A test that targets one image or one helper attaches to that derivation so `nix build .#<name>.passthru.tests.<test>` works and downstream tooling can iterate. Cross-image eval invariants stay in `tests/default.nix` and remain accessible through `checks.eval`. Tests do not run as part of the default image build.

Use `passthru.tests` for the lengthier or downstream-dependent checks (integration runs, fleet renders, end-to-end image boots). Keep `checkPhase` / `installCheckPhase` for the cheap inline checks that should always run on build.

## Searching

Use `mgrep search -c {natural language}` to search the codebase. Do not use subagents for search.

## Linting

```
nix run .#lint
```

The repo wires `.githooks/pre-commit` to the same lint app via `.envrc`'s `core.hooksPath` override, so `direnv allow` is enough to get the pre-commit run on every `git commit`. CI runs `nix flake check`, which has a single `lint` check that calls the same derivation. There is no separate pre-commit framework to install.
