# Module registry. Single source of truth for both:
#   - `nixosSystem { modules = ... }` (leaf paths collected by lib/)
#   - the `modules` flake output (consumed by external users who want one
#     module without depending on ix-base)
#
# Every module is gated on its own `enable` flag. Listing it here only makes
# the options visible; it does not turn anything on. The one exception is
# `profiles/base.nix`, which `ix-base.nix` enables by default.
